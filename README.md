# GRAD521_DMPLang_2020

This is a Data Management Plan for GRAD 521 specific to my own research project. The project goal is to utilize pomace fibers (leftover from food processing steps) that will reduce the amount of this waste that is deferred to landfills while making a useful product in the context of packaging.
