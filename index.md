# Data Management Plan

## Data Description

The purpose of this project is to observe the effect of various modifications on pomace fiber functionality in alternative applications. The effects will be observed through cell wall analysis, shrinkage upon drying, mechanical properties, water absorption, FTIR, DSC, and SEM/stereomicroscope imaging. 

## Roles and Responsibilities

The primary researcher will be responsible for the data from project startup until the end of project. The responsibilities include raw data collection, proper documentation and organization of data and procedures, analysis, and sharing results with the post doc and PI. The PI will be responsible for the implementation of the data management plan and will support the primary researcher to plan, analyze, communicate, and publish the data. At the end of project, the PI will have full responsibility for the archiving of data for new researchers within the lab to utilize. The post doc will be responsible for the quality control of the project: ensuring supplies are within code date, maintaining and calibrating lab equipment, confirming the collection of data is according to standard procedures and analysis is correct and accurate. The post doc will also support data collection and analysis as necessary. The PI and post doc will ensure that the primary researcher has properly documented the research in an organized manner so that data and procedures may be reused in the future. Upon completion of the project, all files will be transferred to the PI and backed up on the cloud. If the primary researcher were to leave, all files from the primary researcher would be transferred to the post doc along with the new primary researcher. This project is temporarily not funded through a specific grant until October; however, confidentiality is a requirement of this research lab. 3.	This data will be considered unrestricted since there the leakage of data would not have extremely adverse consequences on the university. However, some care must still be taken to ensure that the data is not published without consent prior to our own publication.

## Data Standards and Metadata
## Storage and Security
## Access and data sharing
The current dataset can be publicly shared since it does not involve human subjects and will not be patented. It is currently available to the PI, postdoc, and the primary researcher. Upon publication it will be publicly available as attached supplementary information to the journal article. The neat data files will be available in .csv format. The data will be available under license CC BY 4.0. 
## Archiving and Preservation
A data preservation plan will be completed by the end of the project to ensure all information can be incorporated to future projects. The data will be maintained with the PI for at least 15 years. The raw data, neat data, R codes for analysis, and images will be shared with the PI. The PI, primary researcher, and post doc will ensure that the data is well-structured into appropriate folders and subfolders before its archival. Images will be stored as .jpg, spreadsheets as .csv, and metadata/procedural information/R code stored in a .txt format. The PI will be primarily responsible for this data until a new primary researcher continues the project.
