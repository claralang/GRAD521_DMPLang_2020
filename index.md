# Data Management Plan

## Data Description

The purpose of this project is to observe the effect of various modifications on pomace fiber functionality in alternative applications. The effects will be observed through quatitative analysis that will be collected through experimental methods. The data will be collected in excel and saved as a .csv: 
  
  Cell wall components (by % wt): A procedure according to TAPPI 203 and TAPPI 222 will be carried out to measure the alpha, beta, and gamma cellulose and lignin content of the fibers. The weights of the fibers following the respective purification will be recorded. In an excel spreadsheet, these values will be recorded and subsequently calculated into % composition. Spreadsheet: <1MB. 
  
  Shrinkage upon drying: The dimensions of the boards will be measured with a caliper after drying and will be reported as % in comparison to the traditional packaging board <1MB in Excel spreadsheet.
  
  Mechanical properties: A Three Point Bend Test will be performed according to ASTM D790 on Texture Technologies TA XT Plus. The flexural strength, flexural strain, and flexural modulus will be calculated from the results in the Macro extension of the Exponent software. These values will be exported to a <1MB spreadsheet.
  
  Water absorption:  Following ASTM D570-98, water absorption will be recorded. The weights of the boards will be recorded by hand and entered into a spreadsheet. The final calculation will be done in <1 MB Excel document and reported as %. 
  
  FT-IR: The FT-IR spectrometer will measure absorbance vs wavenumber in a graph. I am unfamiliar with the specific software that will be used, but the final data output for interpretation will be a graph. It will be less than 1GB. 
  
  Differential Scanning Calorimetry: Using DSC Q2000 from TA instruments, heat flow and temperature throughout the procedure will be recorded. I am unfamiliar with the software, but the final data output for interpretation will be a graph. <1 GB
  
Qualitative data will be stored in .jpg format:
  SEM/stereomicroscope imaging: Using Scanning electron microscope, high quality images of the fibers will be captured. It will be saved onto the lab drive as well as my personal laptop. <1GB
  
  Iphone photographs: These may or may not be included in the final report. This qualitative data will be stored on my computer and the lab shared drive. ~100 MB

## Roles and Responsibilities

The primary researcher will be responsible for the data from project startup until the end of project. The responsibilities include raw data collection, proper documentation and organization of data and procedures, analysis, and sharing results with the post doc and PI. The PI will be responsible for the implementation of the data management plan and will support the primary researcher to plan, analyze, communicate, and publish the data. The post doc will be responsible for the quality control of the project: ensuring supplies are within code date, maintaining and calibrating lab equipment, confirming the collection of data is according to standard procedures and analysis is correct and accurate. The post doc will also support data collection and analysis as necessary. The PI and post doc will ensure that the primary researcher has properly documented the research in an organized manner so that data and procedures may be reused in the future. Upon completion of the project, all files will be transferred to the PI and backed up on the cloud and an external hard drive. If the primary researcher were to leave, all files from the primary researcher would be transferred to the post doc along with the new primary researcher. 

## Data Standards and Metadata
The food science field does not have any specific metadata standards, since the diversity of projects within this field cannot be confined to one format.

Quantitative data: Cell wall analysis, shrinkage ratio, mechanical properties, and water absorption will be initially written by hand in a lab notebook and transcribed into a spreadsheet. DSC will be directly output to an excel document using the Infinity Pro software. FTIR data will be in a .spc format in the LabCalc software and saved as a spreadsheet. Each spreadsheet will have a readme tab containing appropriate metadata, such as storage conditions of sample, treatment, date, and appropriate methods. The excel spreadsheets will be saved as .csv for later preservation.

Qualitative data: Pictures will be stored in a designated folder. A .txt file will contain appropriate metadata such as treatment, date, time, formulation, camera, and specific procedures used. 

All procedures associated with the data can be located in a .txt document and transcribed into lab notebook for convenient access during experiments including: the reagents, equipment, procedure, and calculations sections follow the same format as our standards for the procedures, such as AOAC. The manufacturer handbook associated with each equipment is also available electronically and physically. 

## Storage and Security
This project is temporarily not funded through a specific grant until October; however, confidentiality is a requirement of this research lab. This data will be considered unrestricted since there the leakage of data would not have extremely adverse consequences on the university. However, some care must still be taken to ensure that the data is not published without consent prior to our own publication.Throughout the duration of the project, the data will be stored on the primary researcher’s computer hard drive. Once a week, or daily once critical data is being collected, the entire computer will be backed up onto an external hard drive using the Time Machine software available on mac. Additionally, the primary researcher will use Box through Oregon State as an additional precaution for backup. The datafiles will be stored in a Box Sync folder for automatic upload to the cloud. Once complete datasets are gathered, the data saved to the post doc and principle investigator’s laptops directly from Box. This is a total of four locations. The data will be retained in this form at least through the completion of the project. Once the project is complete, all raw, clean, and analyzed datasets will be copied onto an external hard drive, shared to Google Drive on personal accounts and shared to the principle investigator in both forms. At the end of project, ideally the data will be published, but in the case it is not published, the PI will retain the data for at least the remainder of her time at OSU.

The data will not be changing or updated frequently enough to justify using a version control software. The files will be stored in a YYYYMMDD format with a simplified title of the procedure (such as DSC for differential scanning calorimetry). Each dataset will have its own folder within the overall project folder. 


## Access and data sharing
The current dataset can be publicly shared since it does not involve human subjects and will not be patented. It is currently available to the PI, postdoc, and the primary researcher. Upon publication (ideally December 2020) it will also be publicly available in a repository as .csv and .jpg files. The data will be ideally published in the Imperial College High Performace Computing Service Data Repository, in which the license is CC0 1.0. This universal license surrenders copyright to the public domain, so it does not require attribution, derivatives are allowed, commercial use is allowed, and no share-alike is required. Upon submission to the repository, the data will have its own DOI for accessibility. 

## Archiving and Preservation
A data preservation plan will be completed by the end of the project to ensure all information can be incorporated to future projects. The data will be stored in a repository within six months of completing the project to ensure it is readily accessible to other labs that may use this data. Careful attention to contracts should be made when transferring data to repositories; it is expected that the repository will manage the data upon publication and will remain accessible even if the repository itself shuts down. 
Additionally, the data will be maintained with the PI for at least 15 years to ensure its longevity within our lab. The raw data, neat data, R codes for analysis, and images will be shared with the PI. The PI, primary researcher, and post doc will ensure that the data is well-structured into appropriate folders and subfolders before its archival. Images will be stored as .jpg, spreadsheets as .csv, and metadata/procedural information/R code stored in a .txt format. These formats apply to data sent to the repositories as well.
